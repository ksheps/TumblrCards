## Rule's of the Game

TumblrCards (we are working on a name) is a role-playing card game. This game is unique in its resource system. Each player begins the game with 10 health. Throughout the game your total mana to spend each turn will be equivalent to your opponent's health total. To explain further, on turn one you will have 10 mana to spend on casting creatures. Any damage you do to your opponent will decrease your available mana to spend. If your opponent's health is at 8, you have 8 mana to spend. If your opponent has 12 health, you have 12 mana to spend.

At the start of each game, the player that takes the first turn is randomly decided. The player that goes first is given the option to have both players start with an extra card, or an extra 5 health (and therefore increasing the amount of mana available to each player at the start of the game).

### The Game

At the start of each game, all players begin with a hand of 4 cards off of the top of their respective 20 card decks. No deck may contain more than 2 copies of any card. No deck may contain more than one copy of any card if that cards mana cost is 6+. Each player also starts the game with 10 health. Depending on which option is chosen by the player that goes first, you may start with 5 cards or 15 health. Each player's turn order is as follows:

1. Start of turn
2. Casting Phase
3. Combat Phase
4. Draw Phase
5. End of turn

Each player's turn follows this same format. Each phase will be explained in detail below. If any card disagrees with the rules below, the rules on the card are to be followed. For a full list of cards from the release set, see the CARDLIST file.

#### Start of Turn

Not much will happen during the beginning of each turn. The game will check for any start of turn triggers on creatures in play, taking priority of the opponent's triggers first. After all triggers have finished, the game will move to the casting phase.

#### Casting Phase

In the casting phase, the player taking his turn may play any card in his hand given he has the available mana. The total mana to spend each turn will be equivalent to your opponent's life total during the Start of Turn phase. To explain further, on turn one you will have at least 10 mana to spend on casting creatures. Any damage you do to your opponent will decrease your available mana to spend. If your opponent's health is at 8, you have 8 mana to spend. If your opponent has 12 life you have 12 mana to spend. During this phase when you cast a creature that costs 2 mana, and you had 10 mana to spend, you will now have 8 mana to spend on other cards in your hand. This phase will continue until you run out of available mana to spend, or you choose to move to the combat phase.

#### Combat Phase

At the bottom of each creature there is an attack and defense (in the form Atk/Def). During the combat phase, the player taking their turn has the opportunity to attack his opponent. However, before damage may be dealt to the opponent, the opponent must not have any creatures on his side of the field. If he has a creature, you must attack and destroy his creature before you are able to attack that player directly. This goes for all creatures your opponent controls. Each creature may only attack once per turn.

All attackers are declared at once, so if you have to attack a creature, you may not attack that creature's controler, unless a card says otherwise.

When two creatures are fighting they deal their respective attack damage against their enemy's defense/health. The creatures deal their damage at the same time. When a creature's defense/health becomes equal to 0 or less, it is considered destroyed. Once all creatures an opponent controls have been destroyed, damage may then be dealt directly to the opponent. If a player plays another creature on their turn, that creature must then be destroyed before damage may be dealt to that payer again.


#### Draw Phase

During the draw phase the player currently taking their turn is given the top card of their deck until they have at least 3 cards in hand. If you already have 3 or more cards in hand, you may draw only one card. There is no maximum handsize at this point in testing. Again the game checks for any triggers that would go off when a player draws a card, for each card drawn. After all triggers are complete the player is given the card(s) and we move to the end of turn.

If a player would draw a card and has no cards left in their deck to draw, that player shuffles his or her discard pile and puts it face down as their deck. The player does not get to draw the card they would have drawn.


#### End of Turn 

Not much else will happen during the end of each turn. The game will check for any end of turn triggers on creatures in play, taking priority of the current player's triggers first. After all triggers have finished the game will move to the next player's start of turn phase.

#### Winning the Game

The game is won when your opponent's health total reaches 0. The game will become increasingly difficult as your opponent's life approaches 0. If a card specifies another way to win (or lose!) follow that cards text.
